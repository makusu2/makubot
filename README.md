## Setup & Installation

You must add your Discord bot token to the environment variable DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN.

In order to use YouTube services, you must set a GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable to a Google API key.

To start, run the docker-compose file, supplying the variables as you wish.

This bot runs best when set up with the resources described in run_remote on AWS.
