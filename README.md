## Setup & Installation

You must enter at least one of `testToken` or `realToken` in project/tokens.py.
In order to use YouTube services, you must set `googleAPI` to a Google API token  in project/tokens.py.
To set up the pipenv environment, run `pipenv install --dev` and then `pipenv run start`.
If you encounter any issues with these commands, please submit an issue!
You can also run `project/__main__.py` instead, if you have set up your environment manually.
